    User is presented with a schedule including 9 text inputs, one for each hour; date at the top. The text input fields change color with the hour to keep the user on track. This website will save the user's schedule they've input when the blue save icon is clicked. It maintains a copy on local storage incase they close the window and need to come back to it.
